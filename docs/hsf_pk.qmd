# Mixed methods Research Data Analysis

> As per my understanding if someone is using : DISCOVERY through
> rigorous qualitative research and then testing using a quantitative
> approach. Unfortunately, most of the research studies simply mention
> some interviews and then there is neither rigorous analysis nor any
> problem identification.

## Objectives

-   Understanding mixed method approach.

-   Analyzing qualitative and quantitative data.

-   Understanding to analyze textual, sentimental, N-Gram: correlations

-   Understand important elements of data, like central tendency and
    spread in practice

-   Correlation, Regression, and Hypothesis testing in practice

-   Becoming familiar with use of R (without downloading and with zero
    coding experience), Excel and datwrapper

## Session 1


### Introduction to softwares

|------------------|------------------|------------------|
| Introduction to softwares: R, SPSS, STATA, NVIVO | With some general benefits of each of these | Why open community softwares and how these |

-   Understanding packages and libraries in R/RStudio Cloud 

### Qualitative data in R

-   Process of working with text data

-   Word frequencies and Word network with n-grams

-   Stop word: removing noise from the data

-   Exploring correlations

-   Twitter/Sentimental analysis

### Quantitative Data Analysis

**Keywords**: constant/variable, nominal/ordinal/interval variable,
dummy variable, Likert item, mode/median/mean.(independent, dependent)
variable, (positive, negative, zero, curvilinear) relationship,
cross-tabulation, mean comparison

### Correlation and Linear Regression with Real Data

**Keywords**: correlation, scatterplot, Pearson's r, multicollinearity,
(multiple) regression, regression coefficient, standard error,
prediction error, "ordinary least squares", partial effects, interactive
effects.

## New ways of having data and analyzing

### Analyzing Google Trends, Google News API, Media API

Discussion of various sources from where one can read all data directly
from web API. - Google trends - Google news API - Media API - UN votes
data from 1948-49 on 6 key issues directly from API till to-date
(Comparing Pakistan and India ) - Participants feedback for way forward
