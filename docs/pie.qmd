## Objectives

-   Delineate variables among various types, like nominal, ordinal and
    interval.

-   Importance of research question and research design for data
    analysis.

-   Understand important elements of data, summarising, visualization
    and tabulating data as per best practices

-   Correlation and Regression, Linear and Nonlinear regressions

-   Forecasting education needs: enrolment, infrastructure, human capita
    and other requirements

-   Becoming familiar with use of R (without downloading and with zero
    coding experience)

-   All slides, data , data codes and related stuff will be handed over
    to reproduce all training material and prepare reports whenever
    required after the training.

## Main Topics

### Defining and Measuring Concepts

conceptual definition, operational definition, unit of analysis,
ecological fallacy, (measurement) reliability, (measurement) validity,
(systematic, random) measurement error, Hawthorne effect, test-restest
method, (face, construct) validity.

### Measuring and Describing Variables with Real Data

constant/variable, nominal/ordinal/interval variable, dummy variable,
Likert item, when can you treat an ordinal variable as
interval/continuous?, mode/median/mean.

### Hypotheses and Comparisons

(independent, dependent) variable, (positive, negative, zero,
curvilinear) relationship, cross-tabulation, mean comparison

### Correlation and Linear Regression

correlation, scatterplot, Pearson's r, multicollinearity, (multiple)
regression, regression coefficient, standard error, prediction error,
"ordinary least squares", partial effects, interactive effects.

### Forecasting

Components of Time Series, Decomposition of Time Series, ARMA, ARIMA,
SARMA and other statistical models

## New ways of having data and analyzing

### Analyzing Google Trends, Google News API, Media API

Discussion of various sources from where one can read all data directly
from web API. - Google trends - Google news API - Media API - UN votes
data from 1948-49 on 6 key issues directly from API till to-date
(Comparing Pakistan and India ) - Participants feedback for way forward
