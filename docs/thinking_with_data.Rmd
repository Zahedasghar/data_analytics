##  The Philosophy and Techniques for Quantitative Research 
### Department of Economics, FJWU, Rawalpindi

## Thinking and data are complement, not substitutes

### Clear thinking is hard specially when mixed up with techniques that surround data and data analysis 
### Simply focussing statistics and econometric techniques: not a good idea
### Miss the forest for the trees 
### Once thinking is focused, techniques will follow 

## AI, ML, Random Forests, ANN, CNN
### We are told that this .orange.bold.i[new technology] will made it possible to do thinking for us. But that's not right, no data analysis, .orange.bold.i[no matter how futuristics its name], will work if we .orange[are'nt asking the right questions], if we are'nt making right comparisons, if underlying assumptions are'nt sound, or if underlying data used are'nt appropriate.
##  .zomp[Learning something new and interesting in the world is our goal]

### .orange[Creative thinking instead of forced feed technique factory-based model for deep introspection about underlying issues/problems/..../]

## What does matter vs why 
### Data mining, ML, AI, ANN... answers: .bold.pink[WHAT]
### Social Sciences :   .bold.pink[WHY]

### False Positive/Negative
### Abstract Theory and Models (4 Levels of knowledge)
### P-Screening , P-hacking, Publication Bias



???
All are very helpful in finding patterns and making predictions are very valuable. 
Social scientistis dilemma
If why is ignored, data mining/ML/AI... are very useful. For example if I dont care why PSX will go up or down and I just want to predict if it will or not, then data mining may be fine
Data mining is bad as final step if you are trying to explain the world

## How do you know if you've got  a good question

###1. Consider Potential Results
###2. Consider Feasibility
###3 Consider Scale
###4 Consider Design
###5 Keep It Simple
::: notes
1. *double check relationship between your research question and your theory to consider potential answers you might get*
**Lets say we do find that kids who happen to play video games are more aggressive. Can we take than result and claim that video games are a cause of aggression?**

2. do we have right data, study involves asking people how much they spent on lunch 3 years back, 10 year study period
3. 
4. Research Desing helps to figure out that whether you can answer the question
A common mistake is to bundle a bunch of research questions into one. __What are the determinants of social mobility?__
You are unlikely to answer questin well. Instead try"Is birth location a determinant of social mobility?"

# Objectives of a regression/econometric model

## Summarising Data

## Forecasting

##Causal/Structural Inference

## Policy Analysis

## Correlation doesn't imply causation

> ### .orange[Most politicians facing scandals win reelection]

#### Correlation : description, forecasting
#### Correlation helps to predict a feature of the world if it is correlated with another feature

### Counterfactuals , Causal Inference


## Ingredients of a quantitative model
###1. An economic theory model of the phenomenon of interest.
###2. A statistical model of the data to be analyzed.
###3. An estimation method for the unknown parameters.
###4. The sample of data to be used.
###5. Evaluation procedures for the adequacy of the fitted model.
###6. A revision process if any mismatch occurs.
###7. An analysis of the properties of the procedure.


### Exploratory Data Analysis
### Confirmatory Data Analysis
### Microeconomic Analysis
### Macroeconomic Analysis
### Softwares : Open community softwares 

## Furuious Five 

### Regression Analysis
### DID
### RDD
### IV
### RCTs
