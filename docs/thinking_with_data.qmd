## [Thinking and data are complement, not substitutes]{.yellow}

::: incremental
-   

    ### Clear thinking is hard specially when mixed up with techniques that surround data and data analysis

-   

    ### Simply focussing statistics and econometric techniques: not a good idea

-   

    ### Miss the forest for the trees

-   

    ### Once thinking is focused, techniques will follow
:::

# AI, ML, Random Forests, ANN, CNN

## We are told that this [new technology]{.yellow} will made it possible to do thinking for us. But that's not right, no data analysis, [no matter how futuristics its name]{.yellow}, will work if we [are'nt asking the right questions]{.yellow}, if we are'nt making right comparisons, if underlying assumptions are'nt sound, or if underlying data used are'nt appropriate.

## Learning something new and interesting in the world is our goal

### [Creative thinking instead of forced feed technique factory-based model for deep introspection about underlying issues/problems....]{.yellow}

## What does matter vs why

### Data mining, ML, AI, ANN... answers: [WHAT]{.yellow}

### Social Sciences : [WHY]{.pink}


## Concepts 

# False Positive/Negative

# Abstract Theory and Models (4 Levels of knowledge)

# P-Screening , P-hacking, Publication Bias

::: {.notes}
??? All are very helpful in finding patterns and making predictions are very valuable. Social scientistis dilemma If why is ignored, data mining/ML/AI... are very useful. For example if I dont care why PSX will go up or down and I just want to predict if it will or not, then data mining may be fine Data mining is bad as final step if you are trying to explain the world

## How do you know if you've got a good question

:::{.incremental}
1. ### Consider Potential Results  

2. ### Consider Feasibility 
3. ### Consider Scale  
4. ### Consider Design 
5. ### Keep It Simple 
:::
# 

1. [*double check relationship between your research question and your theory to consider potential answers you might get*]{.yellow} 
**Lets say we do find that kids who happen to play video games are more aggressive. Can we take than result and claim that video games are a cause of aggression?**

2.  do we have right data, study involves asking people how much they spent on lunch 3 years back, 10 year study period

3.  Research Design helps to figure out that whether you can answer the question A common mistake is to bundle a bunch of research questions into one. > **What are the determinants of social mobility?** You are unlikely to answer questin well. Instead try"Is birth location a determinant of social mobility?" 

## Objectives of a regression/econometric model

### Summarising Data

### Forecasting

### Causal/Structural Inference

### Policy Analysis

## Correlation doesn't imply causation

> ### [Most politicians facing scandals win reelection]{.yellow}

#### Correlation : description, forecasting

#### Correlation helps to predict a feature of the world if it is correlated with another feature

### Counterfactuals , Causal Inference

## Ingredients of a quantitative model

1. ### An economic theory model of the phenomenon of interest. 
2. ### A statistical model of the data to be analyzed.
3. ### An estimation method for the unknown parameters. 
4. ### The sample of data to be used.
5. ### Evaluation procedures for the adequacy of the fitted model. 
6. ### A revision process if any mismatch occurs. 
7. ### An analysis of the properties of the procedure.

### Exploratory Data Analysis

### Confirmatory Data Analysis

### Microeconomic Analysis

### Softwares : Open community softwares 


## Furuious Five
