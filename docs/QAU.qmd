# Analysis  

::: {.callout-note}
This is my assessment and sharing these just as my feedback solely with a positive mindset without any personal interests. I fully understand given the exposure and experience you have, this all may simply be bullshit and can be ignored. 
:::

## Research and Teaching  
- Positive: faculty and research students do their job irrespective of external circumstances
- [Its not research its research which matters, needs face to face deliberations]{.yellow}
- Teaching: Each teacher course outline and lesson plan be made publicly available on each department/school/center websites
- [But these are the most tough measures , so let these come at second or third stage.]{.yellow} 

## Adminstration and Efficiency  
- 80% issues due to capacity and poor functioning of administration
- [files processing system of 1980s]{.yellow}
- admissions issues: outdated approach by the admission office
  - [staff is outdated, very poor response to students/parents who call admission office.]{.yellow} 
  - Needs shuffling in running admission office,but relevant authority in admn wants to stay popular among OWA/EWA 
  
## Controller examination  
  - Controller examination : only demands for more staff but is unable to get work from the staff he has. 
  - [no capacity to execute and lacks basic level leadership required to make examination in expecation of current generation students]{.yellow}
  - needs serious revamp by some highly committed individuals
  - [some young officers should be given more responsibility]{.yellow} 
  
## Fix outcomes besides building capacity

- Building capacity of officers, staff but it will take some time
- [Outcomes can be fixed and daily stand ups (what they did yesterday and will do today)]{.yellow}
- Spins (how difficult tasks were for assessing how much work is done) 
- [Point scoring : Bi-monthly score card for each section]{.yellow}

## Work Culture  

- Improve work culture with some fundamental reforms
  - [stop some social media , newspapers and other browsing through ban on certan social media platforms during office hours]{.yellow} 
  - Monitoring timings of staff entry and exit starting right from admn block 
  - [tracking their total work hours and providing staff only if the section is in really need of it.]{.yellow}
  

## Acadeemic Analysis  
- Ask Deans to bound Chairpersons/Directors for periodic revision and update of courses and place them on website
- [Identify 3 to 5 programs as **flagship**]{.yellow} and their faculty and students should be provided facilities at par with their revenue generations. These departments need encouragement and some high goals for them needs to be fixed.

## Virtual Learning not distance with new ecosytem {.scroll}
- [Click here for my views](https://zahedasghar.netlify.app/posts/higher_education/)
- [Convert common courses online to be taught by one prominent scholar (with very high remuneration) wills save money for more than 150 courses per semester and will bring huge savings.]{.yellow}. I can discuss at length.
- Launch MOOCs with proportionate share to faculty as per enrolment
- [Launch part-time and full time virtual learning skills programs with flexibility to exit and enter (not distance learning) for working learners]{.yellow}

### Result: saving upto 20 to 30 millions 

## Horticulture  

- Closure of plant nursery
    - [Costs : More than Rs.10 million per anum in terms of salary and over time excluding utility]{.yellow}
    - Benefits: Less than Rs.2 million (calculations can be updated)

### Outcome: 5/6 malis will be spared besides a saving of Rs.10 million per year

## Transport  
- Long routes terminal at destination rather having extra redundant trip on daily basis
- [Work on outsourcing of bus system gradually]{.yellow} 
- Fix certain points for buses start and end from where employees and students should join

### Outcome: Huge saving in terms of POL


## Workshop  
- Most easy CBA but me and my staff has to bear the cost when tried to do it.
- [Its a piece rate job. What are total salaries, expenditures and other costs versus what is total output (**monetized**)]{.yellow} 

### Outcome: 10s of millions will either be saved or generated after its regulation and effective functioning

## Supporting Staff and Outsourcing  
Each department has almost 1 to 2 computer lab assistant/attendants recruited in 90s and 2000s for each department computer lab which have become obsolete over time. All that staff is not engaged productively. [Such staff TORs needs to be revisited and their portfolios need to be worked out.]{.yellow}

## Medical center  
- Option to employees/faculty either to surrender their medical bills or facility only for students
- Working with Alumni , medical professionals, volunteers for donations as many are ready to support the cause. [Ambulance in 2016 was from Alumni.]{.yellow}

## Library  
- Get a record of total books issued over last 4 years per capita (students+faculty), if its less than 3 per semester, then library budget should be spent in providing mobile e-libraries at various places with some facilities.
- [Rethink library role in digital world and revamp it accordingly.]{.yellow}
- Stop recruiting library attendants unless needed on urgent basis.

## Outsource Supporting Staff  
- Switch to this model as contractors are supposed to provide services.
- In case of failure, [business as usual]{.yellow} option is alway available.

## Data Center, External Linkages and other centers   
- There should be well-defined business model even some seed money is available and staff should be for project duration.
- [Staff recruited once becomes permanent liability for institutions.]{.yellow}
- Directors of these centers should have clear goals specially of generating some minimum amount through market. 

## ORIC   
- ORIC director should be some [industry person hired on flexible terms]{.yellow}
- Director from industry can only help to commercialize research
- Faculty members, living in Silos, have hardly capacity for research commercialisation as they have little understanding of what happens in real world.

## QEC   
- No comments

## Land Use   

- Area nearby Murree Road should be used for some multi-purpose buildings which can serve as [conference centers, examination centers (like PMDC and other exams), QAU seminars, community as purely business model through public private partnership or with AIOU as once planned.]{.yellow} 
- Botanical garden land should be utilized for multipurpose activities and CBA should also be carried out for it as it maybe another white elephant.
- Many will propose agriculture activities which is hardly a business model
