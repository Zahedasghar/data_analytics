# [Scaling higher education]{.flow} {background-color="#0298ed"}

# Analysis {background-color="#0298ed"}

::: callout-note
It was nice to see you and wish you great success. After meeting you in person and having your thoughts shared during faculty meeting, I think it seems bit unfair to me to replace Prof. Dr. Hasan. So please proceed as per your plan and I have all the support and help.

## Why certificates and micro-credentials {background-color="#0298ed"}

- A micro-credential is a short, competency-based recognition. 

  -   Certificates are usually single course out of a bundle while
  -   micro-credentials are a bundle of courses in certain area (micromaster, data science)
  -   One is free to select even a single course and then second and so on or complete only part of it
 This provides immense flexibility unlike time bound degree

## Why certificates and micro-crendetials {background-color="#0298ed"}

-   Todayâ€™s drivers of higher education are not industries, governments and workers but Gates, Zerchburg, Dell among many others.
  -   Cutting edge area to 21st century are
  -   Nondegree credentialing
  -   Competency-based education
  -   Nontradtional providers
  -   Innovative partnerships


## Industrial era vs digital era educational challenges {background-color="#0298ed"}

> Industrial era change was slow and it took more than 150 years before its integration with the system in the 1960s. 
- digital revolution:  24/7 media information and ocean of data are informing government, public and policy makers. 
- digital technology change is fast as the knowledge economy has a deep impact on higher education. 
- scale of change is far greater than that of industrial era change because the latter required lectures, seminars and laboratories to work with. 

## {background-color="#0298ed"}
Now digital technology helped to reach 100,000 people in a course and has enabled millions of people to get credentials which were not the case in industrial era higher education.  This has created an opportunity for a historically more disadvantaged population and new consumers of education may not look for degrees but some certain skills.
    
## A Demand from all VCs {background-color="#0298ed"}

> I fully agree that universities are there to solve society problems but ours are busy solving their own problems. Taking some liberty,  may I demand you to think even beyond good university management. That demand is provision of educational leadership (thought leadership). Pakistan has VCs and other educational heads but not thought leaders in higher education. So I wish we have people who serve as VCs should also work on becoming thought leaders in this way they will continue their contribution even after the retirement and will get immense reward both here and hereafter
